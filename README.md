# redlist

[redlist](https://github.com/pujangga123/redlist) is template I use to build website. It implements [smarty template](https://smarty.net), [ADOdb](https://adodb.org), [bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com), [jquery](https://jquery.com), and [font-awesome 4](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/icons/). It's a bare minimum setup to make a simple web project.

I created this repository to help a friend who is just starting to learn to make the web. Through this repository, I would like to introduce how to use the template system, separate the program part from the view, using _smarty_.
